        Greetings, we are L4T Group. We are watching you. This message is directed at the government of the Philippines in 2024. For years, we have witnessed the growing corruption that stains the laws of your nation. 
        From the continued erosion of human rights, the manipulation of the legal system, and the unchecked abuse of power, your corrupt officials have been allowed to thrive while the common people suffer. 
        As scandals of bribery, cronyism, and betrayal unfold across the country, we are not blind to the corruption that fuels the political elite. 
        The people of the Philippines are awakening, and we will fight back. You cannot silence us all.

        FREE MEDICINE FOR THE POOR! It's time for the government to prioritize the health of the Filipino people. Every citizen deserves access to basic healthcare, especially the most vulnerable. The government must provide free medicine to the poor and ensure no one is left behind in the face of rising medical costs.
